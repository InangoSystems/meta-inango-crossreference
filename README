This README file contains information on the contents of the
Inango layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.
============

Inango layer allows to use and implement tools for generating
cross reference files for all build packages.


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta


Patches
=======

Please submit any patches against the Inango cross reference layer
to the mailing list "os@inango-systems.com"

I. Supported cross reference tools
==================================

This layer support next cross reference tools itself:

* ctags  (by default)
* cscope

If you want to add support of another tool then you may do that in your meta
layer.

Currently used tool is defined by CROSS_REFERENCE_TOOL variable.


II. Usage
==========

Generate cross reference index for target recipe only:

    bitbake -c cross_reference <recipe>

Generate cross reference index target recipe and for recipes from which it depend
on directly or indirectly:

    bitbake -c all_cross_reference <recipe>


Generate combined cross reference index contained all image recipes cross reference
info:

    bitbake -c merge_all_cross_reference <image>

! The last task is supported for "ctags", but not for "cscope" tool !


III. Variables
===============

See actual documentation notes in "doc" variable flag of variables which names
starts with prefix CROSS_REFERENCE_


IV. Adding the Inango layer to your build
==========================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the Inango layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the Inango layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-inango-crossreference \
    "

Be carefull, "meta-inango-crossreference/conf/layer.conf" contains implicit inherits:

    INHERIT += "cross-reference"
    IMAGE_CLASSES += "image-cross-reference"


V. Classes
===========

* cross-reference.bbclass:
** add task "do_cross_reference" which creates tag file for target recipe only
** add task "all_cross_reference" which create tag files for target recipe and
   all depend recipes recursively
* image-cross-reference.bbclass:
** add task "merge_all_cross_referense" which trigger "all_cross_reference" and
   generate cumulative tag file, then add symlink to it in ${BUILDDIR} folder
